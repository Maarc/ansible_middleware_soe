JBoss middleware orchestration with Ansible [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Maarc/ansible_middleware_soe.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/Maarc/ansible_middleware_soe)
===========================================

This project is an example showing how to implement a Red Hat middleware Standard Operating Environment (SOE) using Ansible and Ansible Tower.

Prerequisites
-------------

To get started quickly with your SOE, you will need to install Ansible, Vagrant and VirtualBox locally. In addition to this, you will have to download and copy the Red Hat JBoss binaries from the [Red Hat Customer Support Portal](https://www.redhat.com/wapps/sso/login.html?redirect=https%3A%2F%2Faccess.redhat.com%2Fjbossnetwork%2Frestricted%2FlistSoftware.html)

*1) Install [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/)*

Please follow [those instructions](https://www.vagrantup.com/docs/installation/) to setup [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/).

*2) Install [Ansible](https://www.ansible.com/)*

* *Centos / RHEL / Other* - Please follow [the official](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/intro_installation.html) instructions.
* *MacOS* - Please follow [those instructions](https://valdhaus.co/writings/ansible-mac-osx/).

*3) Install [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/)*

* *Centos / RHEL / Other* - Please install the `maven` package probably available for your platform.
* *MacOS* - Please follow [those instructions](https://maven.apache.org/install.html).

*4) Retrieve the required Red Hat JBoss binaries*

You have to choose one out of the two following options to download the Red Hat JBoss binaries:

4.1) Re-using locally downloaded binaries

Please download the following Red Hat JBoss binaries from the [Red Hat Customer Support Portal](https://www.redhat.com/wapps/sso/login.html?redirect=https%3A%2F%2Faccess.redhat.com%2Fjbossnetwork%2Frestricted%2FlistSoftware.html) in a local directory of your choice (for example `/opt/tools/jboss/bin`).

* jboss-eap-6.4.0.zip
* jboss-eap-6.4.9-patch.zip
* jboss-eap-6.4.10-patch.zip
* jboss-eap-native-6.4.0-RHEL7-x86_64.zip
* jboss-eap-7.0.0.zip
* jboss-eap-7.0.2-patch.zip
* jws-application-servers-3.0.3-RHEL7-x86_64.zip
* jws-httpd-3.0.3-RHEL.zip

... and edit the `group_vars/all-yml` file to set the `local_rh_bin_dir` to the folder containing your zip files. For example:

		local_rh_bin_dir: /opt/tools/jboss/bin


4.2) Use your your Red Hat Customer Support Portal account to automatically download the binaries

Edit the `group_vars/all-yml` file to set your `rhn_username` and `rhn_password` and comment out the `local_rh_bin_dir` variable. For example:

		#local_rh_bin_dir: /opt/tools/jboss/bin
		rhn_username: MY_ACCESS_REDHAT_COM_USERNAME
		rhn_password: MY_ACCESS_REDHAT_COM_PASSWORD


*5) (optional) Ansible Tower license*

If you wish to use Ansible Tower, you will need ...

* to obtain a valid [Ansible Tower license file](https://www.ansible.com/license)
* to save the license file as "./vagrant/tower/license"


Setup
-----

You have two options to provision your environment:

a) Without using Ansible Tower

		$ ./init.sh

b) Using Ansible Tower

		$ ./init.sh tower

In both cases, it will take a while to create all virtual machines and provision them.


Ansible Tower
-------------

After having intialized the JBoss middleware Standard Operating Environment (using  `./init.sh tower`), you should follow these steps to provision the virtual machines.

Using the credentials displayed at the end of the installation, you will be able to log into Ansible Tower (https://192.168.0.200/) and there:

1. Import the current git repository as a project
    - name: ansible_middleware_soe
    - scm type: git
    - scm url: git@github.com:Maarc/ansible_middleware_soe.git
    - scm branch: master

2. Define a job template
    - name: Roll-out JBoss middleware
    - job-type: Run
    - inventory: Development virtual machines
    - project: ansible_middleware_soe
    - playbook: site.yml
    - machine credential: Vagrant virtual machines (ssh)

3. Run the defined job template

Project structure
-----------------


Here is a brief description of the structure of this projects:

* **files/cli** contains the CLI files used for configuring JBoss EAP.
* **group_vars** contains the ansible [group variables](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/playbooks_variables.html).
* **inventory** contains the [ansible inventory](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/intro_inventory.html). "hosts-dev" lists the host for the development environment. At the same level, you can add a "host-int" or "host-prod" file listing your orchestrated hosts in the integration or production staging environments.
* **roles** contains the main roles of this SOE implementations:
 - **roles/download-binaries** retrieves the Red Hat binaries.
 - **roles/golden-image** creates Red Hat JBoss golden images.
 - **roles/java-demo-app** downloads and builds the demo Java applications.
 - **roles/Maarc.rh-jboss-common** is the core role for all managed hosts.
 - **roles/Maarc.rh-jboss-eap** is the basis role for JBoss EAP instances. The role is quite parametrizable, registers the instance as a service and supports multiple instances on a same host.
 - **roles/Maarc.rh-jboss-web-server-httpd** is a role installing a JWS apache (HTTPD) server.
 - **roles/Maarc.rh-jboss-web-server-tomcat** is a role installing a JWS Tomcat server.
 - **roles/sabre1041.redhat-csp-download** is a role downloading Red Hat JBoss binaries from the customer portal.
* **vagrant/Vagrantfile** contains a description of the virtual machines managed by vagrant.



Troubleshooting
---------------

If you encounter an error looking like ...

		fatal: [host-dev-eap-01]: UNREACHABLE! => {"changed": false, "msg": "SSH encountered an unknown error during the connection. We recommend you re-run the command using -vvvv, which will enable SSH debugging output to help diagnose the issue", "unreachable": true}

... either your virtual machine is down and you need to start it:

		cd vagrant; vagrant up host-dev-01; cd ..

... or restart it ...

		cd vagrant; vagrant reload host-dev-01; cd ..

... or you need to cleanup your .ssh/known_hosts file. For example like that:

		mv -n ~/.ssh/known_hosts{,_$(date +%s).orig}
